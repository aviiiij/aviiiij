<p>Heyyo internet person. I'm Avi. I am a Computer Science Student from Mumbai in my final year. I like to define myself as a very artistic person because I love to read, I sketch portraits, I also sing and well I can play the piano too! :p Not to brag but I absolutely love my hobbies and don't wish to make a career out of it. The thing that drives me and something I am really passionate about is technology. I want to learn the most of this field. I love communicating, getting to know people and I am a team-player. I can work in a team consisting 50 people or 0 people!</p>
