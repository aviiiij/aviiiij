<p>Heyyo internet person. I like to define myself as a very artistic person because I love to read, I sketch portraits, I also sing and well I can play the piano too! 😛 Not to brag but I absolutely love my hobbies and don't wish to make a career out of it. The thing that drives me and something I am really passionate about is technology. I want to learn the most of this field. I love communicating, getting to know people and basically talking!I believe kindness is the way to go always.I love typing, especially Markdowns! People call me evil because of it 😔. Ranting is my specialty and that being said I take my leave 🏃🏼‍♀️</p>
